# OCB Modeling

This repository contains code and resources for modeling the Earth's magnetosphere, specifically focusing on the B6 "Open Close Boundary" (OCB). The modeling is done using Jupyter notebooks and Python, leveraging data analysis and visualization tools to explore the dynamics of geomagnetic fields. Data provided by NASA CDFweb and Tom Sotirelis (JHU APL).

## Features

- **B6 OCB Modeling**: Tools and methods for accurate representation of the Earth's magnetosphere.
- **Data Processing**: Scripts for cleaning and preparing geomagnetic data.
- **Visualization**: Plots and visualizations to understand the OCB dynamics.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arnavsingh0/OCB_modeling.git
cd OCB_modeling
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory.
2. Follow the instructions in each notebook to run the models and generate visualizations.
