# OCB Modeling

Welcome to the **OCB (Open-Close Boundary) Modeling** repository. This work focuses on using machine learning techniques to predict Earth’s **Open-Closed Boundary (OCB)** in the magnetosphere based on multi-satellite data, solar wind parameters, and geomagnetic indices. The OCB is a fundamental boundary in space physics, separating magnetic field lines that remain closed in the Earth’s magnetosphere from those that are open to interplanetary space.

## Overview
This repository hosts various Jupyter notebooks and accompanying data-processing scripts that:
- **Aggregate and preprocess** dayside and nightside datasets.
- **Experiment with preliminary modeling** approaches for OCB prediction.
- **Implement regression and classification** models to achieve high-accuracy predictions.
- **Evaluate performance** using metrics like MSE, RMSE, MAE, and \( R^2 \).

**Data** are primarily derived from:
- OMNI Solar Wind Data  
- Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) OCB observations  
- Other geomagnetic indices (AE, AL, SYM-H, etc.)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arnavsingh0/OCB_modeling.git
   cd OCB_modeling
   ```
2. **Install required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Launch Jupyter**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. **Open** any notebook of interest (e.g., `dayside.ipynb`) to begin exploring the data-processing or modeling steps.

---
## Usage

**Typical workflow**:
1. **Preprocess** data with `dayside.ipynb`, `nightside.ipynb`, and `5MIN_OCBdata.ipynb` to ensure synchronized input features and boundary labels.
2. **Experiment** with initial modeling in `5MIN_Nightsidemodel.ipynb`.
3. **Finalize** classification models in `nightsideModel.ipynb` or `daysideModel.ipynb`. 
4. **Validate or benchmark** performance in `testingRegressionModels.ipynb` or `testingClassificationModels.ipynb`.
5. **Predict** for all MLT's in `acrossMLTpredictions.ipynb`.

**Outputs** include:
- Predicted OCB latitude ranges (classification) or precise prediction (regression).
- Regression metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE, \(R^2\)) and classification accuracy metrics (precision, recall, F1-score).
- Visualizations highlighting OCB predictions versus actual satellite observations.

## Scientific Background

The Open-Closed Boundary is pivotal for understanding how solar wind energy couples into the Earth’s magnetosphere and ionosphere. By applying machine learning techniques—both regression and classification—the project aims to:
- Improve **OCB prediction accuracy** to around 80% in certain configurations.
- Identify **key controlling features** (e.g., AE index, magnetic local time) that drive boundary movements.
- Examine **hemispheric asymmetries** and highlight the need for robust satellite coverage.
